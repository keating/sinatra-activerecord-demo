A demo project with sinatra, activeRecord and erb.
Include the features:
create
read(list all)

There is also a problem need to be resolved, that is displaying the validation messages of a form.

For Heroku:
There is an error when I push to heroku,
PGError: ERROR:  invalid value for parameter "client_min_messages"
Then I forced my ActiveRecord down to 3.0.1 (from 3.1.0), the issue resolved.
Maybe it's the difference between the PG database, mine is PG of version 9, but that on heroku is version 8.

Sorry, forcing the ActiveRecord down, makes the method 'has_secure_password' useless.
So I have to find another way for password.

The example on heroku,
